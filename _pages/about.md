My name is Eugene Kwek, and I am a final-year undergraduate student at Pennsylvania State University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Wenpeng Yin](https://www.wenpengyin.org/) and [Dr. Rui Zhang](https://ryanzhumich.github.io/index.html).

My interests include efficient ML and its usage in real-world applications.
